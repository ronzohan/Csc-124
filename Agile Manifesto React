Effective software development foundations are provided by The Agile Manifesto
as it exhibits the requirement of a developer to a rapidly changing market.  
Developers must go through different iterative phases in developing softwares 
such as planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing to produce high standards software.
In the event that clients require a change in the software being produced,even in the late stage, developers must still be able to deliver quality software as it will show competitiveness on how to handle such pressure.
Agile Manifesto says developers and clients must always collaborate to
deliver the expected software, which is a very effective way to produce high quality softwares. Developers
must should always consult or know what their client needs as some things that the developer may see as a good
way in designing and implementing  softwares, the client may not be in agreement as he/she has other ways to implement the program.
